# Compound Interest Calculator

Welcome to the Compound Interest Calculator project! This simple Python application is designed to help users understand the power of compound interest over time. Created by MikGerm, a dedicated Business Analytics & Information Systems student at the University of Iowa, this project showcases the practical application of Python programming in finance.

## Getting Started with the Calculator

To use the Compound Interest Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that Python is installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MikGerm/compound-interest-calculator.git
   
Sure, let's create a new README.md content for a hypothetical project. This project is going to be a simple Python application that calculates compound interest. I will incorporate your information into the README.md and organize it with different headings for each section as if it were a real, runnable project. This is just an example, so feel free to modify it as needed for your actual project.
