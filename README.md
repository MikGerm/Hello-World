# Welcome to My Project: The First Step into GitHub!

## Overview
As a committed student in Business Analytics & Information Systems at the University of Iowa, I am well-prepared to embark on a career in data analysis, business analytics, and information systems. My educational background in business analytics and engineering, coupled with my proficiency in Python, SQL, Excel, and Access, equips me for various data-focused roles. This repository marks my first step into managing and documenting projects on GitHub.

### Quick Start Guide
**Getting Started:**
To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MikGerm/Hello-World.git

**Customization Steps:**
1. **Username and Project Name**: Replace `yourusername` and `yourprojectname` with your actual GitHub username and the name of your repository.
2. **File Names**: Change `app.js` and `config.yaml` to the actual files you're using in your project. If you have different or additional files, list those instead.
3. **Resources and Links**: The links provided are general; you may want to link to specific resources or documentation related to your project's technology stack or objectives.
4. **Project Specifics**: Add any unique details about your project in the `Overview` section to give readers insight into what your project is about and why it's interesting or useful.

This template meets the assignment criteria by using headings, bold text, bullet points, code blocks, and links. Be sure to review and adjust each section to accurately reflect your project and to showcase your understanding of Markdown and GitHub.
