# Welcome to MikGerm's Hello-World Project

Welcome to my GitHub journey! I'm a Business Analytics & Information Systems student at the University of Iowa. This "Hello-World" repository signifies my introduction to GitHub, focusing on mastering Markdown, understanding repository management, and learning version control. My academic background, combined with practical skills in Python, SQL, Excel, and Access from part-time work, prepares me for data-focused roles. Through this project, I aim to solidify my competencies as a data analyst or business analyst and plan to progress into more specialized areas like data engineering.

To get started with this project, you can clone the repository using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MikGerm/Hello-World.git
